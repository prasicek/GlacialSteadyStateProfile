This repository contains a script to calculate a longitudinal profile of an eroding glacier in topographic steady state (ice surface and bedrock). The steady state solution is based on the shallow ice approximation and a glacial erosion rule. Detailes can be found in this publication (to be filled with jgr url).

The script was written in Python. Additional packages needed are numpy and matplotlib.
